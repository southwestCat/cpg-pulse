# Central Pattern Generator with Defined Pulse Signals for Compliant-Resistant Control of Biped Robots

## sim-railbot-pulse
This is the webots simulation. The world files of `cpg_ds.wbt` and `cpg_ss.wbt` are double-leg support experiment and single-leg support experiment, respectively.

## optimizer
PSO algorithm is implemented here.
